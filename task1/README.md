# Elyx Conversation Simulator

A no-cost, constraint-aware generator that produces 8 months of WhatsApp-style

## Highlights

- Quarterly diagnostics (every ~12 weeks) with Dr. Warren interpretations
- ~5 member-initiated conversations/week (on average)
- Weekly report (Ruby), biweekly exercise updates (Rachel)
- Frequent travel (â‰¥ 1 week out of every 4)
- ~50% adherence to interventions with data-driven plan changes
- Distinct voice & role for each Elyx member
- Exports to `.jsonl` and WhatsApp-like `.txt`

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (standard library only; zero paid APIs or extra packages)
