On labs/vitals BP 128/80, ApoB 95, hsCRP 2.26.
Plan continue the current plan; we’ll review at the next panel; keep hydration and sodium steady.
[3/27/25, 11:35 AM] Rohan: Any quick context on Jet lag meal timing? What’s the simplest version?
[3/27/25, 11:50 AM] Carla (Elyx Nutrition): From this week, restaurant meals look heavier on sodium and refined carbs.
Plan for this week: ask for low-sodium prep, choose grilled fish + steamed greens, and skip late desserts.
[3/29/25, 5:45 PM] Rohan: Any quick context on Creatine and cognition? How does this apply to me?
[3/29/25, 6:00 PM] Advik (Elyx Performance Scientist): Recovery looked a bit suppressed (lower HRV, higher RHR).
My hunch is late meal plus the time-zone shift.
Let's do earlier dinner, 10-min wind-down, and morning light tomorrow.
[3/30/25, 8:50 AM] Advik (Elyx Performance Scientist): Hello Rohan,
Slight drop in HRV with a bump in resting heart rate.
My hunch is body clock mismatch from travel.
Plan earlier dinner, 10-min wind-down, and morning light tomorrow.
[3/30/25, 2:15 PM] Rohan: Reading about Strength training and BP. Worth trying?
[3/30/25, 2:30 PM] Dr. Warren (Elyx Medical): I'm noting occasional lightheadedness on long meetings; sleep latency a bit better.
Latest numbers: BP 128/80, ApoB 95, hsCRP 2.26.
We'll continue with stay the course for now; review at the next panel; hydrate and keep sodium balanced.
[3/31/25, 2:55 PM] Rohan: What’s the simplest version? — re Fish oil purity standards.
[3/31/25, 3:10 PM] Dr. Warren (Elyx Medical): On symptoms, occasional lightheadedness on long meetings; sleep latency a bit better.
Latest numbers: BP 128/80, ApoB 95, hsCRP 2.26.
Plan stay the course for now; review at the next panel; hydrate and keep sodium balanced.
[3/31/25, 6:50 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): On the plus side—ApoB trending down (95.2).
Still a risk—hsCRP 2.26.
This week let’s focus on morning light and earlier caffeine cutoff, Zone-2 plus mobility consistency, and a 10-minute wind-down before bed.
I blocked your workout slots and nudged the gym to hold a squat rack slot — okay to proceed?
[4/1/25, 11:15 AM] Rohan: Reading about Jet lag meal timing. Quick take?
[4/1/25, 11:30 AM] Advik (Elyx Performance Scientist): Night HRV dipped and RHR ticked up vs last week.
Probably short sleep and evening coffee.
Try 10 minutes of breathing before bed and morning light exposure.
[4/2/25, 8:05 PM] Rohan: Curious about Mediterranean vs DASH diet. What’s the simplest version?
[4/2/25, 8:20 PM] Dr. Warren (Elyx Medical): I'm noting occasional lightheadedness on long meetings; sleep latency a bit better.
Current numbers are BP 128/80, ApoB 95, hsCRP 2.26.
Plan no medication changes yet; revisit at the next panel; maintain hydration and sodium balance.
[4/7/25, 8:50 AM] Rohan: Reading about Creatine and cognition. Any risk I should know?
[4/7/25, 9:05 AM] Carla (Elyx Nutrition): From this week, afternoon coffee shows up, and dinner timing’s a bit late.
Plan for this week: morning-only coffee, earlier dinners, and hit two oily-fish meals this week.
[4/7/25, 10:20 AM] Rachel (Elyx PT): Phase 6 went smoothly; no acute pain.
For the next block, move to phase 7 with +1 set on compound lifts; keep RPE 7–8 and switch to suitcase carries during travel if your back tightens.
Keep an eye on tall posture, ribs down, smooth tempo.
Sound okay?
[4/7/25, 10:30 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Good news—ApoB trending down (92.7).
Worth flagging—hsCRP 1.78.
Let’s prioritize morning light and earlier caffeine cutoff, Zone-2 plus mobility consistency, and hydration + electrolytes on travel days.
I sent the updated menu brief to your home cook and looped Sarah to confirm timings — shall I confirm?
[4/10/25, 8:40 PM] Rohan: How does this apply to me? on ApoB vs LDL-C?
[4/10/25, 8:55 PM] Advik (Elyx Performance Scientist): HRV was lower last night and resting HR ran higher.

[4/14/25, 11:10 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): On the plus side—ApoB trending down (90.4).
Still a risk—hsCRP 1.56.
Let’s prioritize morning light and earlier caffeine cutoff, Zone-2 plus mobility consistency, and earlier dinner on work-heavy days.
I nudged the gym to hold a squat rack slot and sent the updated menu brief to your home cook — okay to proceed?
You logged ~4.5h this week; target is 5.0h. Let’s aim for ≥5.0h next week.
[4/14/25, 2:35 PM] Carla (Elyx Nutrition): I'm seeing afternoon coffee shows up, and dinner timing’s a bit late.
How about we keep coffee to the morning, bring dinner earlier, and add two oily-fish meals this week.
[4/15/25, 2:00 PM] Rohan: Quick take? — re Zone-2 heart-rate zones.
[4/15/25, 2:15 PM] Advik (Elyx Performance Scientist): Night HRV dipped and RHR ticked up vs last week.

Likely late caffeine with a stressful day.

[4/17/25, 12:50 PM] Carla (Elyx Nutrition): I'm seeing afternoon coffee shows up, and dinner timing’s a bit late.

No changes — no medication changes yet; revisit at the next panel; maintain hydration and sodium balance.
[4/21/25, 8:45 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Hello Rohan,
Jakarta: plan is on flight day, shift meal timing; get 10–15 min of morning light on arrival; use hotel-gym swaps (DB rows, goblet squats, carries); hydrate with electrolytes.
Okay to proceed?
[4/21/25, 11:40 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): I’m booking this panel — OGTT+insulin, ApoB/ApoA, Lp(a), FBC, LFT/KFT, hsCRP/ESR, thyroid panel, hormones, micronutrients (incl. Omega-3), urinalysis, ECG/Echo/CIMT as indicated, DEXA.
Fasting instructions are in your inbox.

[4/21/25, 12:00 PM] Dr. Warren (Elyx Medical): On symptoms, occasional lightheadedness on long meetings; sleep latency a bit better.
On labs/vitals BP 125/79, ApoB 88, hsCRP 1.57.
No changes — continue the current plan; we’ll review at the next panel; keep hydration and sodium steady.
[4/21/25, 4:00 PM] Rachel (Elyx PT): Hi Rohan,
Phase 7 went smoothly; no acute pain.
For the next block, keep the current progression for two more weeks and reassess.
Keep an eye on tall posture, ribs down, smooth tempo.
Sound okay?
[4/21/25, 5:05 PM] Rohan: Quick take? — re Fish oil purity standards.
[4/21/25, 5:55 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Good news—ApoB trending down (88.3).

This means improving but still above targets for ApoB and BP; inflammation modestly better.
We can go a few ways: continue lifestyle emphasis for 12 weeks, discuss lipid-lowering therapy (pros/cons), or tighten sodium and earlier caffeine cutoff.
[4/26/25, 11:30 AM] Rohan: Curious about Strength training and BP. Worth trying?
